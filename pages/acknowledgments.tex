%TODO: Acknowledgments
First, I express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, Prof. Dr. Andrea Stocco, for his invaluable guidance, support, and encouragement throughout the course of this thesis. His insightful feedback and thoughtful mentorship have greatly shaped the direction and quality of my work. I am especially grateful for the balance that he provided between academic freedom and constructive direction, which allowed me to grow both intellectually and personally.

I would also like to thank my family and friends for their unwavering support and patience during this journey. Their belief in me has been a constant source of strength.
